His employment history with the corp shredded, bank accounts and social channels disappeared, Hiram turned to forgotten analog technology to evade NBN’s gaze.\n Quietly, patiently, Hiram probes corp servers and broadcasts their secrets via copper wires and radio waves. It’s only a matter of time before his signal is detected again. If he’s lucky, the truth will resonate long after he’s gone.",
